# Jeopardy! Game using Pandas and Numpy Library

## Overview
This project exercise from Codecademy involves analyzing a dataset of Jeopardy! questions and answers using the Pandas and Numpy libraries. We filtered the dataset for topics of interest, computed the average difficulty of those questions, and trained to become the next Jeopardy champion!

## Our Findings
We used some Panda's functions to clean and analysed the dataframe and do some aggregate statistics like the avarage of the money value of all the questions and see the difficulty of the question with a specific word. We also used Numpy to perform some numerical operations on the data. And at the end we create a real Jeopardy! Game. 

## Feedback
We would love to hear your feedback on our analysis! If you have any comments or suggestions for the playability of the game, please open an issue on our GitHub repository.
