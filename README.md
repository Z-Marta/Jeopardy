# This is Jeopardy
 Panda library's exercise and built a Jeopardy! game

## Overview
This project involves analyzing a dataset of Jeopardy! questions and answers using the Pandas library. We filtered the dataset for topics of interest, computed the average difficulty of those questions, and trained to become the next Jeopardy champion!

## Our Findings
We used some Panda's functions to clean and analysed the dataframe and do some aggregate statistics like the avarage of the money value of all the questions and see the difficulty of the question with a specific word. And at the end we create a real Jeopardy! Game. 

## Feedback
We would love to hear your feedback on our analysis! If you have any comments or suggestions, please open an issue on our GitHub repository.

### Running the Jeopardy! Game Locally
To run the Jeopardy! Game you need to download it to your local machine. First thing first, you will need to have **Python 3** and **Jupyter Notebook** installed. You can download and install these from their respective websites. Once you have these installed, you will need to install the Pandas library by running `pip install pandas` in your command prompt or terminal.

After installing the required software, you can download the ‘Jeopardy!.ipynb’ file from our GitHub repository and open it in Jupyter Notebook. From there, you can run the code cells in the notebook to play the game. If you encounter any issues or have any questions, please feel free to open an issue on our GitHub repository. We hope you enjoy playing Jeopardy! on your local machine!
